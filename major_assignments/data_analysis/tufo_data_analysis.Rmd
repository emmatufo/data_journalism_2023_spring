data cleaning ideas
- finding census data that matches cities to zipcodes and joining it so we can have a city column
- see which month has the most foreclosures overall
- do outside research about that time of year
- find month with highest percentage of total foreclosures in 2022 because we have all the data

```{r}
md_foreclosure_data <- md_foreclosure_data %>% 
  rename(`February 2022` = `February 2020`)

```

Question 1: a.) Where are there more foreclosure notices? b.) Is it different based on pop? Why? 

*ANSWER*
a.) There are more foreclosure notices in St. Mary's and Dorchester counties, both of which stood out starkly on the map we made. They had 10 and 16 notices by population, compared to around 1 everywhere else. 
b.) The numbers are different based on population. Overall, Upper Marlboro and Baltimore had the highest number of notices, but when we looked based on population, PG and Caroline counties had consistently higher numbers. And two specific zip codes in St. Mary's and Dorchester counties stood out with by far the most.

```

Question 2: When were there the fewest or most foreclosure notices? Why?

**Answer**
It looks like there were the most notices in January 2023. We don't know why, but there is a distinct upward trend over time that doesn't seem to be slowing down. It seems like a trend across zip codes that foreclosure notices are going up. If we had data from before Covid we might be able to compare it and see if it's related to the pandemic. According to Realtor.com it may be a repeat of the Great Recession, and the housing market is shifting because of the economy, which was definitely altered by the pandemic.

    )

```

Question 3: What are the income levels for the most and least foreclosed-upon (noticed) areas and what does the distribution of that look like?

**answer** 
The area with the highest median household income is Showell followed by Bethesda according to the data. Areas with the fewest foreclosure notices  have anywhere between no household income (N/A) and the highest income. It was very spread out. We think that's because it's made of government property, airports, and schools.

Areas with the most foreclosure notices are Upper Marlboro, Raspeburg (a place neither of us has heard of), and Baltimore. They all have comparatively low median household income generally between $30,000 and $50,000. 

Our scatterplot shows essentially what we expected, which is a basic bell curve with more foreclosure notices in the middle-to-low median income zipcodes and significantly fewer as the median income increases.

      x = "median income",
      y = "notices",
      caption = "source: Maryland Open Data      by: Emma Tufo and Sarah Meklir"
    )
```


Question 4: What does the racial demographic data look like in the areas of interest?


*ANSWER*
The five areas with the most overall foreclosure notices were all occupied by majority Black populations. 15 out of the top 20 zipcodes (not counting repeats) were occupied by majority Black populations. That implies there is a racial element influencing either housing, income, foreclosures, or all of those.

Original question 5: Our first question was "How long were people living there before they were foreclosed on?" However after attempting to find good census data and failing repeatedly, we realized it was not a feasible question to answer with the data we had. We are pivoting to a new quesiton. Here is what we tried for that: 
 option 1: "B07001_017 Estimate!!Total:!!Same house 1 year ago: GEOGRAPHICAL MOBILITY IN THE PAST YEAR BY AGE FOR CURRENT RESIDENCE IN THE UNITED STATES"
  Option 2: "B07001_033 Estimate!!Total:!!Moved within same county: GEOGRAPHICAL MOBILITY IN THE PAST YEAR BY AGE FO"
  Option 3: "B07001_049 Estimate!!Total:!!Moved from different county within same state: GEOGRAPHICAL MOBILITY IN THE PAST YEAR BY AGE FOR CURRENT RESIDENCE IN THE UNITED STATES"
  Option 4: "B07001_065 Estimate!!Total:!!Moved from different state: GEOGRAPHICAL MOBILITY IN THE PAST YEAR BY AGE FOR CURRENT RESIDENCE IN THE UNITED STATES" 
  Option 5: "B07001_081 Estimate!!Total:!!Moved from abroad: GEOGRAPHICAL MOBILITY IN THE PAST YEAR BY AGE FOR"
  Option 6: "B07003_001 Estimate!!Total: GEOGRAPHICAL MOBILITY IN THE PAST YEAR BY SEX FOR CURRENT RESIDENCE IN THE UNITED STATES"
  Option 7: "B07201_001 Estimate!!Total: GEOGRAPHICAL MOBILITY IN THE PAST YEAR FOR CURRE
  Option 8: "B07413_001 Estimate!!Total living in area 1 year ago: GEOGRAPHICAL MOBILITY IN THE PAST YEAR BY TENURE FOR RESIDENCE 1 YEAR AGO IN THE UNITED STATES

We thought the idea was to load that data and do some adding to find the number of people who've moved away from their houses and the number who stayed and find the percentage of those who stayed or moved based on pop for the zip code. 
```{r}
census_api_key("577bf4d5bf135998c07189afd7dc2e2d621240d6")
ACS5 <- load_variables(2021, "acs5", cache = TRUE)  

MD_mobility_data <- get_acs(geography = "zcta", state = "MD", variables = "B07003_001", year = 2019)  
MD_mobility_data

MD_immobility_data <- get_acs(geography = "zcta", state = "MD", variables = "B07001_017", year = 2019)  
MD_immobility_data
```

New Question 5: Does the hispanic/latino origin of each zip code's population seem to follow a similar pattern as the pattern found with Black populations in question 4? 

*ANSWER*
There is not a demonstrable correlation between the proportion of hispanic/latino population and the number of foreclosure notices, especially compared to the strong correlation between the Black population and the number of notices. There is more variability in hispanic/latino population among high and low foreclosure notice zip codes, much more than in Black population in those zip codes.

```

**Most newsworthy and how we'd investigate further**
- The findings in question 4 (higher proportion of Black population in areas with more foreclosure notices)
- The two zipcodes from question 1 with significantly more notices

To investigate further, we would look at income level combined with the racial demographic data and try to look into how frequent the residence turnover rate is in those areas compared to higher income level areas. The frequency of turnover must have some connection to foreclosure notices, though we're not yet sure how we could look at specific data for it. It might involve an MPIA request. 

For the zipcodes in St. Mary's and Dorchester Counties, we would go there. We'd look up people in charge of foreclosure and the larger housing lenders in the area, speak to them, and try to find current and former homeowners in the areas willing to discuss their experiences and those they've witnessed. With such significantly higher foreclosure notices, it must be a prominent subject of discussion in the town(s) and there must be people advocating for fewer foreclosures or people with strong opinions and stories they want to tell. There's a lot of potential here for human interest and personal experience stories. By adding those elements it would strengthen the data-heavy reporting we've already done by adding emotion.```{r setup, include=FALSE}

However after attempting to find good census data and failing repeatedly, we realized it was not a feasible question to answer with the data we had. We are pivoting to a new quesiton. Here is what we tried for that: 
 option 1: "B07001_017 Estimate!!Total:!!Same house 1 year ago: GEOGRAPHICAL MOBILITY IN THE PAST YEAR BY AGE FOR CURRENT RESIDENCE IN THE UNITED STATES"
  Option 2: "B07001_033 Estimate!!Total:!!Moved within same county: GEOGRAPHICAL MOBILITY IN THE PAST YEAR BY AGE FO"
  Option 3: "B07001_049 Estimate!!Total:!!Moved from different county within same state: GEOGRAPHICAL MOBILITY IN THE PAST YEAR BY AGE FOR CURRENT RESIDENCE IN THE UNITED STATES"
  Option 4: "B07001_065 Estimate!!Total:!!Moved from different state: GEOGRAPHICAL MOBILITY IN THE PAST YEAR BY AGE FOR CURRENT RESIDENCE IN THE UNITED STATES" 
  Option 5: "B07001_081 Estimate!!Total:!!Moved from abroad: GEOGRAPHICAL MOBILITY IN THE PAST YEAR BY AGE FOR"
  Option 6: "B07003_001 Estimate!!Total: GEOGRAPHICAL MOBILITY IN THE PAST YEAR BY SEX FOR CURRENT RESIDENCE IN THE UNITED STATES"
  Option 7: "B07201_001 Estimate!!Total: GEOGRAPHICAL MOBILITY IN THE PAST YEAR FOR CURRE
  Option 8: "B07413_001 Estimate!!Total living in area 1 year ago: GEOGRAPHICAL MOBILITY IN THE PAST YEAR BY TENURE FOR RESIDENCE 1 YEAR AGO IN THE UNITED STATES

We thought the idea was to load that data and do some adding to find the number of people who've moved away from their houses and the number who stayed and find the percentage of those who stayed or moved based on pop for the zip code. 
```{r}
census_api_key("577bf4d5bf135998c07189afd7dc2e2d621240d6")
ACS5 <- load_variables(2021, "acs5", cache = TRUE)  

MD_mobility_data <- get_acs(geography = "zcta", state = "MD", variables = "B07003_001", year = 2019)  
MD_mobility_data

MD_immobility_data <- get_acs(geography = "zcta", state = "MD", variables = "B07001_017", year = 2019)  
MD_immobility_data
```

New Question 5: Does the hispanic/latino origin of each zip code's population seem to follow a similar pattern as the pattern found with Black populations in question 4? 

*ANSWER*
There is not a demonstrable correlation between the proportion of hispanic/latino population and the number of foreclosure notices, especially compared to the strong correlation between the Black population and the number of notices. There is more variability in hispanic/latino population among high and low foreclosure notice zip codes, much more than in Black population in those zip codes. 
```{r}
census_api_key("577bf4d5bf135998c07189afd7dc2e2d621240d6")
ACS5 <- load_variables(2021, "acs5", cache = TRUE)  

MD_demographic_data <- get_acs(geography = "zcta", state = "MD", variables = "B02001_001", year = 2019) %>%    
  rename(race_total = estimate) %>% 
  mutate(GEOID = as.double(GEOID))

MD_hispanic_latino_data <- get_acs(geography = "zcta", state = "MD", variables = "B03002_012", year = 2019) %>%    
  rename(hispanic_latino_total = estimate) %>% 
  mutate(GEOID = as.double(GEOID))

MD_black_data <- get_acs(geography = "zcta", state = "MD", variables = "B02001_003", year = 2019) %>%    
  rename(black_total = estimate) %>% 
  mutate(GEOID = as.double(GEOID))

q5_md_data_and_boundaries <- md_data_and_boundaries %>% 
  left_join(MD_hispanic_latino_data, by=c("zip"="GEOID")) %>% 
  left_join(MD_demographic_data, by=c("zip"="GEOID")) %>% 
  left_join(MD_black_data, by=c("zip"="GEOID")) %>% 
  mutate(black_pct = (black_total/race_total)*100) %>% 
  mutate(hispanic_latino_pct = (hispanic_latino_total/race_total)*100) %>% 
  summarize(race_total, hispanic_latino_pct, black_pct, zip_overall_total, zipname) %>% 
  arrange(desc(zip_overall_total))
  
q5_md_data_and_boundaries
```

**Most newsworthy and how we'd investigate further**
- The findings in question 4 (higher proportion of Black population in areas with more foreclosure notices)
- The two zipcodes from question 1 with significantly more notices

To investigate further, we would look at income level combined with the racial demographic data and try to look into how frequent the residence turnover rate is in those areas compared to higher income level areas. The frequency of turnover must have some connection to foreclosure notices, though we're not yet sure how we could look at specific data for it. It might involve an MPIA request. 

For the zipcodes in St. Mary's and Dorchester Counties, we would go there. We'd look up people in charge of foreclosure and the larger housing lenders in the area, speak to them, and try to find current and former homeowners in the areas willing to discuss their experiences and those they've witnessed. With such significantly higher foreclosure notices, it must be a prominent subject of discussion in the town(s) and there must be people advocating for fewer foreclosures or people with strong opinions and stories they want to tell. There's a lot of potential here for human interest and personal experience stories. By adding those elements it would strengthen the data-heavy reporting we've already done by adding emotion.
